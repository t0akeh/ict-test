# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# ðŸª– Platoon Logbook â€“ ICT Admission Test (Frontend Challenge)

This is a simple web-based logbook application built as part of the ICT Conscript Admission Test.

It helps a platoon record daily events more efficiently than using a paper logbook. The app supports viewing and creating log entries, making situational awareness better in the field.

the code probably does not look clean since didnt have much time but  i hope it is good enough.
